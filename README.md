### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently a Computer Science student at UBC Vancouver.
- 🌱 I’ve developed with my team Something borrowed - a full-stack web app to lend and borrow items within a neighbourhood using MERN stack.
- 🌱 Also developed Vancity Foodiee personally which is a MERN stack web app to add and store recipes.
- 👀 I want to further explore coding in Python, via the Python #100DaysOfCodeChallenge by the LondonAppBrewery.
- 😬 <b>*Actively* looking for CO-OP opportunities</b>
